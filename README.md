Sinatra portfolio project for Flatiron

## Overview

 This is your one stop shop to look at all your battle pets in the Massive Multiplayer Online Game (MMO) World of Warcraft (WoW). Instead of using a site with extra info, this is dedicated to your battle pets. Create your account and add in the pets as you collect them. You can also edit, update and delete pets as needed.
